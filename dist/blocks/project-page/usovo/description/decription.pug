					p O&A Design took on a mansion in Usovo, which belonged to Russian Emperor Alexander II and his family, in 1864. The Emperor and his family were instrumental in the area's infrastructure and contributed much to its rich history. The modern owners were keen to respect the heritage of the building whilst creating an ultra-modern family nest — a ‘nest of nobility’.
					p Oleg and Anna had an ambitious and inspirational approach to the architecture and design of the property. The entire ground floor space — 1000 square meters in total — was combined to create an open plan lounge, library and dining room, and the guesthouse was transformed into a spa. The new owners possessed a unique collection of 18th and 19th-century paintings, which became a point of reference when creating the interior.
					p A mansion for the 21st century was created, in which past and present are lightly intertwined.
